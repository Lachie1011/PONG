# **PONG** <br/> 
**This was originally a university assignment, however due to the extreme open-ended nature of the assignment, I figured it was a suitable piece of my work that highlghts my interest in low-level and embedded software programming** <br/> 
The aim of this project was to recreate the famous game of PONG onto an ATMEL328 microcontroller. <br/><br/>
**Functionality:** <br/> 
- Both a PVE and a PVP mode (selected by holding the button on the far left on start-up). 
- Six LEDS, represents the score of each player. Three lit indicates the other player has won. 
- Tone whenever a paddle hits the ball, a potentiometer is included to adjust volume. 
- Four buttons, two for each player. Left moves paddle up, right moves paddle down. <br/> <br/> 

**Improvements** <br/>
- Optimisation, improve the way the interrupts are handled. <br/>
- Optimisation, improve the way the ball and paddles are drawn to the screen, so that it is not so jittery. <br/> 
- Include a reset button in the actual functionality. <br/> <br/>
